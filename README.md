how i use : every 10 mins a question from organic chemistry hijacks my system , simliar in my phone also . keeps track of question in both phone and pc due to state.json being synced repetitively. 

more use case :

create an app?

maybe train ai with the questions and answer ?

the scraped data is insane , has more statistical like data weightage per year , topics wise segregation , ettc etc . so u could use this in some way ?



scraped data : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1zeFuIBNz642G77UhTeK8l4Hz7iMmmbQk


for jee
unzip main.zip from link , and run the app.py . intall flask before doing it . 

example for other exams : 
 choose the exam from drive folder if you want jee exam , copy the jee folder and paste it in ui_l2j as   subjects (reanme exam to subjects)
